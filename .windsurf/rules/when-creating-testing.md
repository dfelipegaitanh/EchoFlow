# MUST DO

- Use PEST for any PHP code

# Testing Practices

- ** Always ** Write unit tests for business logic if needed.
- ** Always ** Write feature tests for integration and end-to-end testing if needed.

## Explanation

- Tests ensure code correctness and prevent regressions.
- Unit tests focus on business logic without external dependencies.
- Integration tests verify that components work together correctly.
